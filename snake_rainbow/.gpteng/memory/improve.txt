PLANNING:
To make the snake multicolored with vibrant rainbow colors that are constantly changing, we need to modify the `Snake` class's `draw` method to assign a different color to each segment of the snake. We will use a list of rainbow colors and cycle through them as we draw each segment of the snake. We will also need to update the `constants.py` file to include the list of rainbow colors.

Here are the steps we will take:

1. Update `constants.py` to include a list of rainbow colors.
2. Modify the `draw` method in `snake.py` to use the list of rainbow colors for each segment of the snake.

OUTPUT:

```python
constants.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Colors
BACKGROUND_COLOR = (0, 0, 0)
SNAKE_COLOR = (0, 255, 0)
FOOD_COLOR = (255, 0, 0)
=======
# Colors
BACKGROUND_COLOR = (0, 0, 0)
# SNAKE_COLOR is removed as we will use RAINBOW_COLORS for the snake
FOOD_COLOR = (255, 0, 0)
RAINBOW_COLORS = [
    (148, 0, 211),  # Violet
    (75, 0, 130),   # Indigo
    (0, 0, 255),    # Blue
    (0, 255, 0),    # Green
    (255, 255, 0),  # Yellow
    (255, 127, 0),  # Orange
    (255, 0, 0),    # Red
]
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
snake.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    def draw(self, screen):
        for position in self.positions:
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, SNAKE_COLOR, (*position, SNAKE_SIZE, SNAKE_SIZE))
=======
    def draw(self, screen):
        for index, position in enumerate(self.positions):
            color_index = index % len(RAINBOW_COLORS)
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, RAINBOW_COLORS[color_index], (*position, SNAKE_SIZE, SNAKE_SIZE))
>>>>>>> updated
```

These changes will result in a snake that has each segment drawn in a different color from the rainbow, creating a vibrant, multicolored effect. The colors will cycle through the list, creating a rainbow pattern that changes as the snake moves and grows.
